But a dream within a dream?O God! can I not grasp
While I weep--while I weep!
And I hold within my hand
Is it therefore the less gone?
Thus much let me avow--
Is it therefore the less gone?
One from the pitiless wave?
I stand amid the roar
Take this kiss upon the brow!

Is all that we see or seem

Is it therefore the less gone?
Through my fingers to the deep,
