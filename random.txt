Yet if hope has flown away
Grains of the golden sand--
I stand amid the roar
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Is it therefore the less gone?
Yet if hope has flown away
Yet if hope has flown away
One from the pitiless wave?
That my days have been a dream;
O God! can I not save
You are not wrong, who deem
And, in parting from you now,
In a vision, or in none,
In a vision, or in none,
One from the pitiless wave?
You are not wrong, who deem
Them with a tighter clasp?
