-But a dream within a dream?O God! can I not grasp
-While I weep--while I weep!
-And I hold within my hand
 Is it therefore the less gone?
+While I weep--while I weep!
+In a night, or in a day,
+All that we see or seem
 Thus much let me avow--
+In a vision, or in none,
+Them with a tighter clasp?
+You are not wrong, who deem
 Is it therefore the less gone?
-One from the pitiless wave?
-I stand amid the roar
-Take this kiss upon the brow!
+And, in parting from you now,
+In a night, or in a day,
+In a night, or in a day,
+How few! yet how they creep
 
-Is all that we see or seem
-
-Is it therefore the less gone?
-Through my fingers to the deep,
+One from the pitiless wave?
+Yet if hope has flown away
